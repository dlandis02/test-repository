     <h2>Whenever I am not working on my goal of becoming a fullstack web developer</h2>
     <h2>I can be seen participating in musical ensembles or hiking</h2><br>
     <h1>Music</h1>
     <h3>I started playing the tuba when I was in fourth grade. As I went through school I continued practicing.As I got into middle school I joined the jazz band and started exploring other types of musical ensemble groups.As I went into highschool I decided to join my highschool's marching band. I was a member of the band for four years and was section leader for three of those years.I was also a member of my counties youth symphony orchestra for three years and was the principle member for two of those years. </h3><br><br>
     <h1>Hiking</h1>
     <h3>While I was living in Israel for nine months I began to really enjoy hiking. I enjoyed learning about the history of the trail and the important history that has happened on the trail. </h3>
